<h2>About verb-o-matic</h2>

<p>
Verb-o-matic is an open source web application designed to assist people who want to learn foreign or ancient languages or IPA symbols online. It currently features three kinds of exercises: 1) a vocabulary training exercise, 2) a verb form identification exercise, 3) an IPA symbols exercise.
</p>

<h2>System requirements</h2>

<p>You need an up-to-date browser to use verb-o-matic properly. I recommend to use a recent version of Firefox. You need to have Javascript enabled, but you don't need cookies. There are some known issues with older browser.
</p>
<h2>WARNING</h2>
<p>Please note that there may still be issues with verb-o-matic, in both the code and the content. Please report any issues you find to the <a href="https://github.com/lvcivs/verb-o-matic/issues">bugtracker</a>.</p>

<h2>Contribute</h2>
<p>You are more than welcome to contribute to verb-o-matic! Please check out the source code and data on <a href="https://github.com/lvcivs/verb-o-matic">Github</a>. All content of the exercises are in plain UTF-8 encoded text files, which should make it hopefully easy for you to design your own exercises, if you wish to do so.</p>
<p>(Earlier, it used to be hosted on <a href="https://code.google.com/archive/p/verb-o-matic">Google Code</a>.)</p>
